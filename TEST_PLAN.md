# Test Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the project, following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. The plan covers both frontend and backend testing, with a focus on automation and continuous integration.

## Test Pyramid
1. **Unit Tests** (70%)
   - Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library
   - Backend: Rust unit tests
2. **Integration Tests** (20%)
   - API contract tests
   - Component integration tests
3. **End-to-End Tests** (10%)
   - Cypress for frontend
   - Postman/Newman for backend

## Test Automation Strategy
### Frontend Testing
- Unit tests for React components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Visual regression testing

### Backend Testing
- Unit tests for Rust modules
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Performance testing
- Security testing

## Test Coverage Goals
- 80% unit test coverage
- 60% integration test coverage
- 40% end-to-end test coverage

## CI/CD Integration
- Automated test execution on PRs
- Test reporting and monitoring
- Fail-fast strategy for critical tests

## Test Data Management
- Use of mock data for unit tests
- Test data factories for integration tests
- Database snapshots for E2E tests

## Reporting and Monitoring
- Test execution reports
- Code coverage reports
- Test failure alerts
- Historical trend analysis

## TDD Workflow
1. Write failing test
2. Implement minimum code to pass test
3. Refactor code while maintaining passing tests
4. Repeat for each feature/task

## Test Case Management
- Test cases linked to TASKS.md items
- Traceability matrix for requirements
- Automated test case generation where possible

## Performance Testing
- Load testing for critical paths
- Stress testing for API endpoints
- Monitoring of key performance metrics

## Security Testing
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing for critical components
